# FORMATUS

A plain Flutter Rich-Text-Editor without any dependencies.

## Features

* Runs on all platforms
* Supports multiple section and inline formats
* Easy integration into `TextField` and `TextFormField`
* Small and easy to use
* No dependencies to other packages
* Includes a viewer for the formatted text

## Getting started

Add the latest version of *Formatus* to the `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
flutter:
  formatus: ^2.0.1
```

Create a `FormatusController` and a `FormatusBar`.
Supply a `FocusNode` to both the `FormatusBar` and the `TextField` or `TextFormField`.


## Usage

Use `Formatus` like this:

```dart
  FocusNode focusNode = FocusNode(debugLabel: 'formatus');
  late FormatusController controller;
  String savedText = '';

void initState() {
  controller = FormatusController( formattedText: savedText,
      onChanged: (v) => setState(() => savedText = v ),);
}

Widget build(BuildContext context) => Column( children: [
  FormatusBar(
    controller: controller,
    textFieldFocus: _formatusFocus,
  ),
  TextFormField(
    controller: controller,
    focusNode: _formatusFocus,
    minLines: 3,
    maxLines: 10 ),
  ]);

//--- Don't forget the standard dispose of the controller
void dispose() {
  controller.dispose();
}
```

## Supported Formats

* __H1__ → Header 1 with largest font size
* __H2__ → Header 2 with larger font size
* __H3__ → Header 3 with large font size
* __P__ → Paragraph with standard font size
* __OL__ → Ordered list
* __UL__ → Unordered list
* __B__ → bold text
* __I__ → italicized text
* __U__ → underlined text
* __S__ → strike-through text
* __sub__ → subscript text
* __sup__ → superscript text
* __color__ → text coloring

## Known Deficiencies

1. Horizontal ruler not yet implemented
2. Coloring is restricted to 19 included colors
3. Line-breaks in pasted text are replaced by spaces
4. Lists cannot be nested
5. Subscript and superscript are displayed correctly only in [FormatusViewer] because Flutter
   [TextField] and [TextFormField] do not support them

## User Manual

### Definition of Terms

Caret
: visible display of the cursor position 

Format
: All text has a format. Its format is specified by the section format and all inline formats applied to the text

Section
: All text belongs to a section. Each section has a format. Multiple sections are separated by a newline


### Use cases

This section describes the use cases for `Formatus`.

* Position caret → updates `FormatusBar` with formats at caret position
* Select a text range → updates `FormatusBar` with formats from selection start
* Activate another section-format in `FormatusBar`
  → the current section (defined by caret position or start of a selected text-range)
  will be changed to the activated section-format
* Change an inline-format in `FormatusBar` → if a text range is selected
  then the selected text will be updated with the new format
* Enter characters (via keyboard or by pasting from a clipboard) → characters
  will be inserted at caret position. Current format settings will be applied
* Delete characters → if this includes one or more (requires a text-range)
  line-breaks then the text right of the deleted text will be integrated
  into the top-level node at deletion start
* Display the formatted text with `FormatusViewer`


## Future Enhancements

1. Add format for unordered list
2. Add format for ordered list (auto-counting)
3. Add anchor with editable reference and displayed text
4. Add action to insert an emoji. This should become an optional add-on action
   similar to `FormatusAnchor`. Could also include converting an emoji name
   into emoji inline (insert into current text node).
5. Implement a `FormatusHistoryController` which supports formats and color
6. Parse markdown as formatted input
7. Export formatted text in markdown format
